it snowed all day. It snowed all day, wet and heavy snow, leaving slippery patches on the sidewalks and secret muddy puddles in the midst of the park grass. I told Scout I was going twelve miles and by the time I was ready the sun was setting. All forces conspired against me. I don't want to do it. It's cold, it's wet, it's windy and icy and dark. I'm not fighting space, or orbit, or the angle of the earth's presentation to the sun, I'm fighting myself. I'm fighting boredom. If I can commit to being bored enough for long enough, I will be released from suffering.

If I go be bored enough for long enough often enough, eventually the fog will part, the sun will pierce my ignorance and sorrow. I will go be bored in the ice wind and look down for the muddy patches. I will follow the thread of my boredom out of the labyrinth of my suffering; and if my ignorance cannot be eradicated, at least let it be transformed into a so-called opportunity for personal growth, into an opening for advertisements and sponsored content, into a shrine for our high priests of marketing.

The virtues are worthless when there's no one around to see you living them.

I'm going to tell somebody where I'm going because if she poisons me I want someone to have a clue. The Chicago Police Department doesn't solve a lot of murders but I can give them a head start on this one: alone, far from home, I was driven by horniness to the door of someone with good reason to be angry.

we are for peace; swords into ploughshares;
put the guns in a museum and the museum in the ocean.

The city, O Chicago, you have neighborhoods I actually want to live in, and chocolate I can afford.

The sauce was a thick, white, flavorless paste. The gnocchi were cold and raw. The best part was the beer flight, seven rocks glasses half-filled with warm and foamless pours.

how often do we have to bare our pain and ask for each others' forgiveness at this noisy, dusty, dangerous street corner? it must have been more fun in the nineties.

The chain does 25% of its annual business between Thanksgiving and New Years, so we're just trying to use dry January to get a lot of cleaning done. But my manager says we're doing a lot of business for a January. People are struggling.

We made cookies, my ebay laptop showed up, we saw the Wave at the Art Institute and Scout's mom asked if he (the artist, Katushika Hokusai, 1760-1849) was also there to talk about the work. I said yes. Scout said no.
