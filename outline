I couldn't find her if I looked, every day I look in places I know she isn't, every day the same three streets, the same two bars, only my hunted sagging face in the windows of the shops I can't afford. I don't even bother. For you I would ask the prices, for you I would smash the glass, for you I would clutch lightning, swallow thunder, hoist the sun onto my back and throw it into neverending cold lake michigan. Come home, love me, tell me we'll be brave and beautiful forever.

sometimes we use this fourth wall to pretend you're not where you are so i can pretend i am where i am

even my deepest sacrifices were all for my own benefit

i want glory without duty and adoration without virtue

my horniness, laziness, and greed have metastasized into an alternative politics. if i had a stronger survival drive i would be a monogamous liberal with no opinions about Marx or Lenin. i would not need to believe in god or god. i would choose to believe in free will.


i can make you cry without raising my voice or sounding confrontational in any way. i can sound interested in the most terrible idea that has ever vibrated the air. i can encourage you to pursue it. i can congratulate you when you succeed.

i should have gone back to bed a long time ago.
and stayed there.
and put the lid on tight so i didn't get moldy.


it doesn't matter how many times you say the magic words
    (communities of care) (radical self-acceptance) (take accountability)
the truth is you're just like me
    a liar and a cheat,
    a coward and a thief
    and i sentence you to walk in shame under ten thousand hanging pianos




and i'm just like you
flat on the sidewalk
a hot red paste

asking myself if the circumstances excuse my hypocrisy, and they always do.
O, beautiful world.




don't walk under any hanging pianos or
God might suddenly change her mind about you
